# The reason why Object Oriented Programming is called that is because
# it's trying to model  real world object.
# So, let's say we are creating a virtual restaurant, in this case,
# we probably have to model a virtual chef, waiter, cleaner and manager.

# On Python, a function but if we call it a method, is because it's a 
# function that particular modeled object can do.

# In Object Oriented Programming, we're trying to model real-life objects
# and those objects have things and they can also do things.

# The things they have are Attributes, and there are usually modeled
# with variables.
# The things that they can do are called methods and they are modeled
# by functions.
