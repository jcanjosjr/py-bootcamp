# Having the exponent beint built into the language is one of
# the reasons why Python is really loved by a lot of data
# scientists and mathematicians, because it's really optimized
# towards manipulating and handling numbers.

# Order of priority is: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication,
#                       Division, Addition and Subtraction.

# Example:
print(3 * 3 + 3 / 3 - 3)
print(3 * (3 + 3) / 3 - 3)
