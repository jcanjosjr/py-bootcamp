Focusing on automating tasks on servers, improving routines in productive environments, I started to study Python again,
this time, doing my first bootcamp focused on programming 100% in English.

This repository will focus on keeping the code focused on language structure, on raw data, on file handling, and on exercises.

For each class focused on web development, backend applications and database, new repositories will be created.

On the end of the course, I wan't to make a RSA Algorithm with Python, and expectate that course improve my skills on my Career of DBA, and give me an idea
of how the data area really works.
