# List is what you would call a Data Structure, it's just
# a way of organizing and storing data in Python.

# https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp

# It's just a set of square brackets with many itens
# stored inside.
fruits = ['item1', 'item2', 'item3']

# Those itens can be any data type, they can even have
# mixed data types like you could store strings together
# with numbers or a set of booleans.
# The order is determined by the order in the list.
