# When we call this function and we pass over this piece of
# data, we're creating a new variable called 'name', and we're
# setting it to equal this piece of data that we're passing it.
# Basically, this being referred to as the parameter and this
# piece of data referred to as the argument.

# The parameter is the name of the data that's being passed in.
# The argument is the actual value of the data.
